Machine Learning

Using OpenCV, built a program for a robotic arm to detect a line. Video capture from the camera wassplit into frames, each frame is processed to reduce obstacles that would slow the detection processsuch as - greying out, blurring (to remove image noise) using Gaussian Blur and also creating an area offocus. The line is detected based on its edge and contours have also been taken into account to be moreprecise.

Using TensorFlow, built a program to detect an object. After capturing images from the internet, theimages were annotated using LabelImg. Single Shot MultiObject Detection algorithm was found to bebest with regards to speed, when used in a manufacturing plant and to increase its accuracy MobileNetwas combined. Processed images were converted to tfRecords, which was used to train the MobileNetSSD model provided by TensorFlow. Before testing the model, an inference graph is generated to use asa source of truth during the detection phase. OpenCV is used to feed the model with video stream fromthe camera, then with the trained model and label map (to detect multiple objects) are loaded ontomemory. Scores are kept as a confidence check, higher the number most likely to be the object as in thetrained model. Boxes drawn on the image, labelled with detected object.

Web Application

Used PHP to build the server and HTML + CSS to design the user interface. The website was built to bean online e-commerce portal for a fashion design studio. It was hosted using a third party service.Used Django as the framework to build a website that was hosted on AWS EC2 and used AWS RDS asthe database. The website was built as a custom Sensor as a Service tool allowing users to selectsensors to build a sensor management service. Boto3 was used to integrate the EC2 operations withDjango.

Used Python to build a Flask server to host a finance website to display best stock options. GoogleCloud Platform was used to host the Flask server.

Developed an application to determine the safety factor of a locality using the data captured from apublic data source. The data stored in MongoDB, was used for visualizing graphs through tools likeTableau and Google Charts. The application was built using Express which is a web framework built forNode.JS and the user interface was enhanced using Angular.JS

Bangalore, India

Developed ABAP script to retrieve confirmations with errors and automate the fix to the same.Developed a BW extractor to gather data and transfer to the BW/BI system.
